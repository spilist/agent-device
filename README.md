Device automation CLI for AI agents. Mobile, TV, and desktop apps.

`agent-device` lets coding agents run real apps, inspect UI state, interact with visible elements, and collect debugging evidence through one CLI.

It is built around token-efficient accessibility snapshots, not pixel-first screenshots. Agents read compact UI trees, locate elements through refs like `@e3`, perform touch and text actions, and capture screenshots, video, logs, network, CPU/memory/perf, crash-related logs, and React profiles only when evidence is needed.

Agents can ingest the current docs from [llms-full.txt](https://incubator.callstack.com/agent-device/llms-full.txt). The installed CLI help remains authoritative for exact command syntax.

## Agentic QA And Development

- **Quality Assurance**: dogfood flows, validate PR builds, check accessibility coverage, and turn stable explorations into `.ad` e2e tests.
- **Development**: build from specs, inspect real runtime behavior, and iterate until the UI matches the work.

`agent-device` closes the agentic development loop: agents can write code, run the real app, verify the UI end-to-end, collect screenshots/videos/logs/perf evidence, and feed bugs, crashes, or performance findings back into the next fix iteration before a human reviews the PR.

If you know Vercel's [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser), this is the same idea for apps and devices.

Use it for AI mobile testing, AI QA for React Native and Expo apps, iOS Simulator automation, Android Emulator automation, tvOS/Android TV checks, and desktop app verification from coding agents. Humans install and configure `agent-device`; agents run the workflows.

Demo: Codex uses `agent-device` to inspect iOS Contacts through accessibility snapshots, interact with visible UI, and create a contact from a simple prompt.

## Quick Start

Install the CLI first:

```bash
npm install -g agent-device@latest
agent-device --version
agent-device help workflow
```

The CLI help is the source of truth for agents and is shipped with the installed version. Skills are optional but recommended when your agent runtime supports them: they auto-route device, React DevTools, and dogfood tasks to the right `agent-device help <topic>` page and verify the CLI is new enough before acting.

If you install skills separately, keep the CLI on `agent-device >= 0.14.0`. Older CLIs do not include the workflow help topics that the router skills expect.

### AI Agent Entry Points

- **Agent + terminal**: in Cursor, Codex, Claude Code, Windsurf, and similar clients, run `agent-device` in the integrated terminal. Start planning with `agent-device help workflow`; CLI help is authoritative.
- **Skills or rules**: install the skill with `npx skills add callstackincubator/agent-device`, use the bundled [agent-device skill](skills/agent-device/SKILL.md), or mirror it as a thin project rule, so the agent checks the installed version and reads `agent-device help workflow` before acting. Use `agent-device help rn-performance` for slow RN flows that need React DevTools profiles, log markers, network evidence, and a component performance report.
- **MCP router**: use `agent-device mcp` when an MCP-aware client needs install, status, and version-matched help discovery. MCP is intentionally a thin router; device automation still runs through CLI commands.

For client-specific setup, see [AI Agent Setup](https://incubator.callstack.com/agent-device/docs/agent-setup). For agent-readable docs, use [llms-full.txt](https://incubator.callstack.com/agent-device/llms-full.txt).

### MCP Router

`agent-device` ships an official stdio MCP router for discovery-oriented clients. It exposes only `status`, `install`, and `help` tools plus workflow prompts/resources; it does not expose device automation or generic shell execution over MCP.

Paste one of these into clients that accept `mcpServers`, such as Cursor project `.cursor/mcp.json` or user-level MCP settings.

<details>
<summary>Global install MCP config</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-device": {
      "command": "agent-device",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>No global install MCP config</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-device": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "agent-device@<reviewed-version>", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Registry metadata uses MCP name `io.github.callstackincubator/agent-device`, npm package `agent-device`, stdio transport, `mcpName` package verification, `server.json`, and `smithery.yaml`.

```bash
npm install -g agent-device@latest
agent-device --version
agent-device help
```

`agent-device` performs a lightweight background upgrade check for interactive CLI runs and, when a newer package is available, suggests a global reinstall command. Updating the package also refreshes the bundled `skills/` shipped with the CLI.

Prerequisites: Node.js 22+, Xcode for iOS/tvOS/macOS targets, Android SDK + ADB for Android, and macOS Accessibility permission for desktop automation. See [Installation](https://incubator.callstack.com/agent-device/docs/installation).

Try the loop.

```bash
# Find the app.
agent-device apps --platform ios

# Start a session.
agent-device open SampleApp --platform ios

# Inspect the current screen. -i returns interactive elements only.
agent-device snapshot -i
# @e1 [heading] "Settings"
# @e2 [button] "Sign In"
# @e3 [text-field] "Email"

# Act, capture a screenshot, and close.
agent-device fill @e3 "test"
agent-device screenshot ./artifacts/settings.png
agent-device close
```

Snapshots assign refs like `@e1`, `@e2`, and `@e3` to current-screen elements. Refs from the default snapshot are immediately actionable; for hidden content, scroll and re-snapshot.

### First 5 Minutes: Expo Test App

Use the bundled Expo fixture when you want a concrete first agent run with setup checks, screenshots, replay, and performance evidence. This path requires a repo checkout because `examples/test-app` and the `pnpm test-app:*` scripts are not included in the published npm package.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/callstackincubator/agent-device.git
cd agent-device
```

First terminal:

```bash
pnpm test-app:install
cd examples/test-app
npx expo-doctor@latest
cd ../..
pnpm test-app:ios
# or: pnpm test-app:android
```

Then give your agent this prompt:

```text
Use agent-device to dogfood the bundled Expo app and produce an evidence-backed report.

Setup:
- Read `agent-device help workflow`, `agent-device help dogfood`, `agent-device help debugging`, and `agent-device help react-devtools` before planning commands.
- Confirm the test app setup commands were run: `pnpm test-app:install`, `cd examples/test-app && npx expo-doctor@latest`, then `pnpm test-app:ios` or `pnpm test-app:android`.
- If Metro prints an Expo URL, prefer opening the shell with that URL. On iOS use `agent-device open "Expo Go" <url> --platform ios`; on Android use the visible Expo/dev-client target or URL. Confirm the app UI with `snapshot -i`.

Run:
- Create `./dogfood-output/screenshots`, `./dogfood-output/videos`, `./dogfood-output/traces`, `./dogfood-output/perf`, and `./dogfood-output/replays`.
- Open a named session `expo-qa` and save a replay script to `./dogfood-output/replays/expo-test.ad`.
- Use command shapes like `agent-device --session expo-qa open "Expo Go" <url> --platform ios --save-script ./dogfood-output/replays/expo-test.ad`, `agent-device --session expo-qa screenshot ./dogfood-output/screenshots/home.png`, `agent-device --session expo-qa perf --json > ./dogfood-output/perf/baseline.json`, and `agent-device --session expo-qa record start ./dogfood-output/videos/checkout.mp4`.
- Capture a baseline `snapshot -i`, screenshot, and `perf --json` sample.
- Exercise Home, Catalog, product detail, Checkout, and Settings. Re-snapshot after each mutation and use refs/selectors from fresh snapshots.
- Capture at least one overlay-ref screenshot, one normal screenshot, one short video recording for a meaningful flow, logs marks around any issue, and trace output if a runtime symptom needs diagnostics.
- Run focused performance checks: compare `perf --json` before and after a navigation or form flow; if React DevTools connects, capture profile slow/rerender output. If it cannot connect, include the status and continue.
- Close the session so the `.ad` replay is written.

Report:
- Write `./dogfood-output/report.md`.
- Link every screenshot, video, trace, log path, replay file, and performance artifact you used.
- Include setup results, platform/device, Expo doctor outcome, coverage, severity counts, findings with repro commands, and a short performance section summarizing startup/CPU/memory/frame-health or React profile findings.
- If no issues are found, report covered flows and residual risk instead of claiming the app is bug-free.
```

## Where To Run agent-device

| Path | Best for | Start with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local | Exploration, debugging, and development loops on simulators, emulators, physical devices, macOS apps, and Linux desktop targets. | Follow the Quick Start. |
| CI/CD | Automated PR and merge validation with replay scripts and captured artifacts. | Start with the [EAS workflow template](https://github.com/callstackincubator/eas-agent-device/blob/main/.eas/workflows/agent-qa-mobile.yml). GitHub Actions template coming soon. |
| Cloud / remote execution | Linux runners, managed devices, and remote execution. | Use [Agent Device Cloud](https://agent-device.dev/cloud), see [Commands](https://incubator.callstack.com/agent-device/docs/commands) for remote profiles, or [contact Callstack](mailto:hello@callstack.com) for team-scale QA. |

## Capabilities

- **Platforms**: iOS, Android, tvOS, Android TV, macOS, and Linux. Real devices and simulators are supported.
- **Agent-native UI model**: token-efficient accessibility snapshots, current-screen refs for exploration, selectors for durable replay, and skill-tested workflow guidance.
- **Capture and debug**: screenshots, video, logs, network traffic, CPU/memory/performance data, crash-related logs, accessibility snapshots, and React render profiles.
- **Produce**: replayable `.ad` scripts (recorded replay files that run locally or in CI), e2e test runs, snapshot and screenshot diffs, and debugging artifacts.
- **React Native and Expo**: component tree inspection, props/state/hooks, and render profiling.
- **MCP boundary**: discovery and help over MCP; app/device control through the CLI for explicit, auditable commands.
- **License**: MIT. Free to use.

## How It Works

`agent-device` runs session-aware commands through platform backends: XCTest for iOS and tvOS, ADB plus the Android snapshot helper for Android, a local helper for macOS desktop automation, and AT-SPI for Linux desktop targets. See [Introduction](https://incubator.callstack.com/agent-device/docs/introduction) and [Commands](https://incubator.callstack.com/agent-device/docs/commands) for platform details.

Node consumers can use the typed client and public subpaths for bridge integrations. `agent-device/android-adb` exposes the Android ADB provider contract, logcat/clipboard/keyboard/app helpers, and port reverse management.
